# <My Prework-study-guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I have been playing around with code since 2000 although very sparsely, I used word pad to create hypertext links to switch betwwen multiple page websites and then again in 2014 where I was trying to learn from CD/DVD and build basic one page websites, zoom forward to April 2023 and I am in the position where I want to do this as a full time job and hopefully make a difference in the world. 
- Why did you build this project?
I am very interested in what a few words (ok, a ton of words) can do, like when HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all linked together and shows an amazingly sculpted webpage. This is hopefully just the very begginning for me!
- What problem does it solve?
We learned how to debug using the instructions provided and pieced together a webpage for practice.
- What did you learn?
Gosh, I learneed so much, April 2023 I started going through FreeCodeCamp and was shown a load of questions to complete to make an incredible website without truly understanding how it all pieced together, this project was amazing, it really helped me link the languages together and using GitHub aand Git Bash is mind blowing!



## Installation

## Usage

We started off with HTML and it showed us the basic structure of a Webpage, next we styled the background and text with CSS, we also added a picture in HTML and then Resized it and centered it on the page. Finally we started using JavaScript and thats where it got a little difficult for me, I've never used javascript before but it was equally exciting and I can't wait to learn more. We used the Web Dev tools on Google chrome to look at the console log and it shows which JavaScript is running. I loved learning how to use Git, I cant say I remember all of the Push, Pull and commit commands but hopefully over time I will cement them to memory.
